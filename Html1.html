      Idli or idly (About this soundpronunciation (help·info)) (/ɪdliː/) are a type of savoury rice cake, originating from the Indian subcontinent, popular as breakfast foods in Southern India especially Tamilnadu and among Tamils in Sri Lanka. The cakes are made by steaming a batter consisting of fermented black lentils (de-husked) and rice. The fermentation process breaks down the starches so that they are more readily metabolized by the body. Idli has several variations, including rava idli, which is made from semolina. Regional variants include sanna of Konkan.
